# Simon Memory Challenge v2.0

## Overview
Welcome to Simon Memory Challenge v2.0! This web-based memory game is an enhanced version inspired by the classic Simon game. Test your memory skills and have fun with this interactive and user-friendly game.

## Project Evolution
Simon Memory Challenge v2.0 was developed during the Angela Yu Web Development Course while learning jQuery. As part of the course, we were tasked with creating the initial version of the Simon game with proper guidance. After completing the initial version, I observed that the game lacked a user-friendly experience, especially for those unfamiliar with the Simon game.

Realizing the need for improved user guidance, I decided to create version 2.0. This updated version focuses on providing a more intuitive and understandable interface for users. The goal is to enhance the overall user experience, making the game accessible and enjoyable for players of all levels.
